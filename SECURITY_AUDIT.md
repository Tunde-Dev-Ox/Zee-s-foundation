# Security Audit Report - Zee's Foundation

## Executive Summary
After reviewing your codebase, I've identified several **critical and medium-priority security vulnerabilities** that need immediate attention. While you've implemented some good practices (Stripe integration, proper .gitignore), there are significant gaps that could expose your application to attacks.

---

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. **Missing Security Headers**
**Risk**: XSS, Clickjacking, MIME-sniffing attacks
**Location**: `next.config.ts`
- No Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- No X-Frame-Options
- No X-Content-Type-Options
- No Referrer-Policy
- No Permissions-Policy

**Impact**: Attackers could inject malicious scripts, iframe your site, or execute MIME-sniffing attacks.

---

### 2. **API Routes Lack Rate Limiting**
**Risk**: DoS attacks, API abuse, brute force
**Location**: `src/app/api/checkout/route.js`, `src/app/api/customer-portal/route.js`
- No rate limiting on payment endpoints
- Vulnerable to cost attacks (creating many Stripe sessions)
- Can be exploited for financial abuse

**Impact**: Attackers could create unlimited Stripe checkout sessions, potentially costing you money or causing service disruption.

---

### 3. **Insufficient Input Validation**
**Risk**: Injection attacks, data corruption
**Location**: Both API routes

**Issues Found:**
- `email` field not validated (format, length)
- `amount` has no maximum limit (could allow extremely large amounts)
- `frequency` not validated against allowed values
- `session_id` in customer-portal not validated (could be any string)

**Impact**: Invalid data could corrupt records, cause payment failures, or enable abuse.

---

### 4. **Information Disclosure in Error Messages**
**Risk**: Information leakage, reconnaissance
**Location**: Both API routes
- `error.message` exposed to clients (line 76, 21)
- Stripe error details leaked (could reveal internal structure)
- `console.error` in production could expose secrets

**Impact**: Attackers could gain insights into your system architecture or exploit specific error conditions.

---

### 5. **Missing Environment Variable Validation**
**Risk**: Runtime failures, undefined behavior
**Location**: Both API routes, `contentfulClient.ts`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` not validated (could be undefined)
- Stripe client initialized outside route handler (could fail silently)

**Impact**: Application could fail unexpectedly or operate insecurely if env vars are missing.

---

## ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### 6. **Contentful Access Token Exposed**
**Risk**: Unauthorized access to CMS
**Location**: `src/lib/contentfulClient.ts`
- Using `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix exposes token to client-side
- If using read-only token, this is acceptable, but should be documented
- Consider using server-only if write access is available

---

### 7. **No Request Size Limits**
**Risk**: DoS via large payloads
**Location**: API routes
- No body size validation
- Could accept arbitrarily large JSON payloads

---

### 8. **Missing CORS Configuration**
**Risk**: Unauthorized cross-origin requests
**Location**: API routes
- No explicit CORS headers
- Relies on Next.js defaults (should be explicit for production)

---

### 9. **Client-Side Amount Validation Only**
**Risk**: Bypassed validation
**Location**: `src/app/components/card/donationCard/page.tsx`
- Validation only on client-side
- Can be bypassed by direct API calls

**Note**: Server-side validation exists but could be more robust.

---

## âœ… GOOD PRACTICES FOUND

1. âœ… `.env` files properly gitignored
2. âœ… Using Stripe for payment processing (secure)
3. âœ… No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage found
4. âœ… No `eval()` or `Function()` constructors
5. âœ… Server-side API routes (not exposed client secrets)
6. âœ… TypeScript usage (compile-time safety)

---

## ðŸ”§ RECOMMENDED FIXES

### Priority 1 (Immediate)
1. Add security headers to `next.config.ts`
2. Add input validation and sanitization
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Add environment variable validation
5. Sanitize error messages

### Priority 2 (Within 1 week)
6. Add maximum amount limits
7. Implement proper email validation
8. Add request size limits
9. Configure explicit CORS

### Priority 3 (Within 1 month)
10. Review Contentful access token scope
11. Add request logging and monitoring
12. Implement webhook signature verification (if using Stripe webhooks)
